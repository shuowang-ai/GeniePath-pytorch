# GeniePath-pytorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of the GeniePath model in [GeniePath: Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Receptive Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00910)

> GeniePath, a scalable approach for learning adap- tive receptive fields of neural networks defined on permuta- tion invariant graph data. In GeniePath, we propose an adap- tive path layer consists of two complementary functions de- signed for breadth and depth exploration respectively, where the former learns the importance of different sized neighbor- hoods, while the latter extracts and filters signals aggregated from neighbors of different hops away. Our method works in both transductive and inductive settings, and extensive ex- periments compared with competitive methods show that our approaches yield state-of-the-art results on large graphs

## TODO

- [x] Finish the rough implementation, f1_score: 0.9709
 for GeniePath,  0.9762 for GeniePathLazy (dim = 256, lstm_hidden = 256). 
- [x] Tune the model
